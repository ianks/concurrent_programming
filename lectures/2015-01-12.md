# Course Overview

- Fundamentals: models, algorithms, impossibility
- Real World programming: architectures, techniques

## Mutual Exclusion

- Requirements:
  - No more than one thread can be in its critical section at any one time.
  - A thread which dies in its critical non-critical section will not affect the
    others' ability to continue.
  - No deadlock: if a thread wants to enter its critical section then it will
    eventually be allowed to do so.
  - No starvation.
  - Threads are not forced into lock-step execution of their critical sections.

## Scaling

- More cores does not automatically give you more speed. Typically, you will
  still have unused CPU cores.

## Asynchrony

- Sudden unpredictable delays
  - Cache misses (short)
  - Page faults (long)
  - Schedule quantum used up (really long)

## Model Summary

- Multiple threads
- Single shared memory
- Objects live in memory
- Unpredictable delays
